# Movies Data Analysis
Author: John Kanoru Macharia

## Overview
Microsoft  wishes to venture into the movie industry and is clueless on where to start. My duty is to analyze the given data and draw actionable insights for Microsoft that will give them an edge as they venture into these industry. Utilizing descriptive statistics and visualizations on the given data, I have been able to establish trends in the data. For example, movies released in July, November and June respectively had the highest returns on investment(ROI).

## Business Problem
Microsoft are clueless about movie production and they want to create a new movie studio.
For the new movie studio to be profitable, some of the factors Microsoft needs to be aware of are:

- Length of the movies. How long should the movies be?
- Genres. What genres are most common and profitable?
- Release period. What is the ideal period for them to release movies and be profitable?

## Data
I utillized data from 4 different sources to have an extensive understanding of the movie industry.

- Box Office Mojo. Box Office Mojo is an American website that tracks box-office revenue in a systematic, algorithmic way.This dataset contains values for movie title, domestic and worlwide gross, studio name, and year of release.
- IMDB.IMDb is an online database of information related to films, television series, home videos, video games, and streaming content online â€“ including cast, production crew and personal biographies, plot summaries, trivia, ratings, and fan and critical reviews.This dataset contains values for movie name, production budget, domestic and worldwide gross, crew details, genre, runtime, release year and average rating.
- The Numbers.The Numbers provides detailed movie financial analysis, including box office, DVD and Blu-ray sales reports, and release schedules.This dataset contains values for movie name, release date, production budget, domestic and international gross.
- The Movie DB.The Movie Database is a popular database for movies and TV shows. Their API is a system made freely available for data acquisition. There is a very large amount of data available on TMDb. This dataset contains values for genre ids, original language,	original title,	popularity,	release date,	title, vote average, and	vote count.

## Results
The histogram shows that movies with runtimes of approximately 90 to 120 minutes had the highest ROI's with the peak at approximately 100 minutes.

Movies released in the months of May, June, July and November had the highest ROI's compared to other months with September, October and December having the lowest ROI's.

## Conclusions
The following conclusions can be made from the analysis of the movie data:

- Produce movies with runtimes of 90 - 120 minutes.
- Movie release dates should be kept within the months of May, June, July and November.
- Microsoft could consider acquiring either of the top grossing studios: BH Tilt,Neon or Orchard film studios.
- It would be ideal if Microsoft produced movies of the most common genres,i.e,documentaries, drama and comedy.
